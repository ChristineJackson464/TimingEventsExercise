D. Inside the “TimingEventsExercise” folder create a app.js file
E. Inside the index.html file create the HTML boilerplate and set the title of the page to “Timing Events Exercise”
F. Link the style.css and app.js files to the index.html file
G. Paste the following HTML into your index.html file after the opening body tag…
  <h1>setTimeout</h1>
  <div id="first"></div>
  <h1>setTimeout Nesting</h1>
  <div id="timeout-nesting"></div>
  <h1>setInterval Countdown</h1>
  <div id="countdown"></div>

  margin-top: 20px;
}
I. Start your Live Server (NOTE: Must be in the index.html file to do this)
J. Open your app.js file and complete the following...1. Use a setTimeout method to have "Hi" displayed as a p element/tag inside the div with the id of "first" 1 second after the page loads.
2. Use nested setTimeout methods to complete the following: Have the text of "One" displayed as a p element/tag inside the div with the id of "timeout-nesting" 2 seconds after the page loads. Also, below the "One" p element/tag, have the text of "Two" also displayed as a p element/tag inside the same div 3 seconds after the page loads.
3a.  Use a setInterval method to display a counter in the console that starts at 1 and continues going up one number at a time every second.
3b. Have the "STOP" button set up so that when it is pressed the setInterval method created in 3a will stop continuously running (HINT: Need to create a variable).

BONUS

B-4. Using setInterval, display a countdown clock as a p element/tag inside the div with the id of "countdown". Have the countdown clock start at 2 minutes and count down. The countdown clock should display in the following format (Example: 2:00 to start and 0:00 at end). ALSO, when the countdown timer hits zero have it display a message saying… "TIME IS UP" instead of the clock (AKA 0:00).
